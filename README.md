# Hospital_Bed_Capacity_and_Patient_Flow_Data
Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a data analytics and prediction model to optimize hospital bed capacity utilization, reduce patient waiting times, and support the efficient allocation of resources in emergency situations.

Project Summary
This project aims to analyze and model simulated hospital dataset to optimize bed occupancy and patient flow. By predicting patient admissions and bed occupancy rates, the model helps improve service quality during peak periods. Forecasting models will provide hospital management with early insights into future occupancy trends, allowing for better decision-making and resource planning.
